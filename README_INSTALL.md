# Installation instructions

## Preamble
Unix based server reccommended. 
All commands are specified for Ubuntu 12.04.
Provided installation process was tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

You can use standard installation instructions from [here](https://github.com/prove/tarantula).  
The differences are:
- proxy server used (current procedure is for nginx)
- current procedure is for advanced users
- after standard installation you'll need to perform following [additional actions](https://getsatisfaction.com/prove/topics/jira_link) to intgrate with oracle hosted jira.   

## Installation process

1. Install rmv on your system, details can be found [here](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/)
2. Install ruby with rvm (1.9.3 recommended) 
3. Install bundler:     rvm 1.9.3 do gem install bundler
4. Install git on your system, details can be found [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
5. Create directory to hold the application code (will be reffered to as APPS)
6. CD to $APPS
7. Clone source code of the application: `git clone git@github.com:evgeniy-khatko/tarantula.git`  
8. CD to $APPS/tarantula
9. Install required ruby gems to run the app:  
#### if you don't plan to integrate Tarantula with oracle hosted jira
  `bundle install --without development oracle_enabled` 
#### if you plan to integrate Tarantula with oracle hosted jira
  install oracle development libraries with [oracle instant client](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html)   
  `bundle install --without development`   make sure that bundle install finishes successfully  
10. Install mysql
11. Create database, e.g. tarantula
12. Provided you have mysql user with admin privileges => user:secret
13. add following lines to $APPS/tarantula/config/database.yml:  
      <% get_socket = lambda{ ["/opt/local/var/run/mysql5/mysqld.sock",   
                               "/opt/lampp/var/mysql/mysql.sock",  
                               "/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock",  
                               "/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock"].\  
                              detect{|p| File.exists?(p)} } %>  
      production:  
      <space>adapter: mysql2  
      <space>database: tarantula  
      <space>username: user  
      <space>password: secret  
      <space>host: localhost   
      <space>encoding: utf8  
      <space>socket: <%= get_socket.call %>    
14. run following command to finish tarantula installation (assuming you're in $APPS\/tarantula)
         bundle exec rake tarantula:install => follow instruction
15. run following command to start delayed jobs: rake tarantula:jobs:work (assuming you're in $APPS\/tarantula)      
16. test your installation trying to start server with following command:     bundle exec rails s (assuming you're in $APPS\/tarantula)
*Proceed to next steps if everything is OK*
17. install nginx server on your system
18. install nginx passenger module with following command:     passenger-install-nginx-module
19. configure nginx to use passenger module with adding following commands to your nginx.conf:  
      http {  
          passenger_root /path/to/rvm/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p286/gems/passenger-3.0.18;  
          passenger_ruby path/to/rvm/.rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.3-p286/ruby;  
          passenger_default_user your_server_user;  
          passenger_default_group your_server_group;  
          include       mime.types;  
          default_type  application/octet-stream;  
          sendfile        on;  
          keepalive_timeout  65;  
        server {  
          listen 80;  
          server_name tarantula.myserver.com;  
          root $APPS/tarantula/public;   # <--- be sure to point to 'public'!  
          passenger_enabled on;  
          charset utf-8;  
        }  
      }  
20. navigate to nginx listening port and test your installation

P.S.
it's recommended to create a capistrano task to automate server code update
